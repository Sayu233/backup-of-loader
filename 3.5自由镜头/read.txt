Common Issues:
  1. A dialog showing "The program can't start because xxxx.dll is missing" 
       -> you need to install/reinstall vcredist (https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
  2. A dialog showing "Error at hooking API ..."
       -> you need to install/reinstall vcredist
  3. loader.exe prints "xxx failed, status: 0xc0000005"
       -> anti virus is blocking it
  4. loader.exe prints "xxx failed, status: 0xc000010a"
       -> retry a couple times, if it still doesn't work, try verifying game files
  5. Crashed when loading after game update
       -> wait for me to update
  6. What to do if anti virus blocked the file?
       -> add it to your AVs whitelist (ask google)
